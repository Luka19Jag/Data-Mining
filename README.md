# Data-Mining

Here are the projects I did in the Data Mining course.

Project 1 deals with the problem of market segmentation and the well-known RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method. Before that, it was necessary to organize the dataset, by pivoting and merging tables with additional data manipulation.

Project 2 is the application of machine learning algorithms on the Insurance and Wine dataset. Weak predictive algorithms were used such as: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN. In addition to the application of algorithms, the concept of using Pipelin from the Sckit-learn package (performing multiple operations in a sequence) and transforming numerical variables into categorical ones and vice versa is applied.

Project 3 is the most serious. A very heavy dataset is used for prediction (Kaggle - Mercari). In addition to data processing and manipulation, here are methods for generating new variables based on text (CountVectorizer), attribute selection (Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded methods). Also, new machine learning algorithms are applied, such as ensemble algorithms.
